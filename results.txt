Recipe Name: Poulet et Riz Élégant (Elegant Chicken and Rice, naturally) 

Ingredients
* 1 boneless, skinless chicken breast, preferably organic and free-range. If it isn't, don't even bother.
* 1/2 cup Arborio rice. None of that inferior long-grain nonsense.
* 2 cups chicken broth, homemade, of course. Store-bought? *Scoffs*
* 1 shallot, finely minced. A proper shallot, mind you, not some oversized onion imposter.
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, European-style. The flavor is far superior.
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, cold-pressed, from a reputable source in Italy.
* Pinch of saffron threads, because we need a touch of elegance. (If you *must* substitute, use turmeric... I guess.)
* Fresh parsley, finely chopped, for garnish. Use Italian parsley, if you want my respect.
* Salt and freshly ground white pepper, to taste. Black pepper is far too barbaric for this dish.

Steps 
1. First, ensure your kitchen is impeccably clean. One cannot create a masterpiece in a disorganized environment.
2. Season the chicken breast with salt and white pepper. Lightly, darling, we don't want to overwhelm the delicate flavor.
3. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter with the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced shallot and sauté until translucent, but not browned. Burnt shallots? Sacrilege!
4. Add the Arborio rice and toast it lightly, stirring constantly, for about 2 minutes. This releases the starch and creates a creamy texture.
5. Pour in 1 cup of the chicken broth and the saffron threads. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 15 minutes, or until the rice is almost tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
6. While the rice is cooking, in a separate pan, melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Sear the chicken breast until golden brown on both sides. Don't overcook it; we want it tender and juicy, not rubbery.
7. Add the remaining cup of chicken broth to the rice. Continue to cook, uncovered, until the rice is cooked al dente. Stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
8. Once the rice is cooked al dente, nestle the seared chicken breast on top of the rice.  Cover for about 5 minutes to finish cooking the chicken thoroughly.
9. Remove the chicken from the pan and allow it to rest for a moment. This allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in a more succulent final product.
10. Slice the chicken breast thinly and fan it over the rice. Garnish with fresh parsley. Serve immediately, and try not to disgrace me by adding ketchup.
