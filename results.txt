  "recipe_name": "Deconstructed Volaille et Riz: A Study in Simplistic Disappointment",
  "ingredients": [
    "One (organic, free-range, naturally fed, of course) chicken breast, skin on",
    "Arborio rice, sourced from a small, biodynamic farm in Piedmont, Italy",
    "Shallots, minced with the precision of a surgeon",
    "Dry white wine, something crisp, perhaps a Sancerre if you must",
    "Chicken stock, homemade, I trust?",
    "Butter, oh, the creamiest, most decadent French butter you can find",
    "Fresh thyme sprigs, because why not pretend we have some refinement?"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "First, the chicken: score the skin lightly and season generously with sea salt and freshly cracked white pepper. Sear skin-side down in a screaming hot pan with a touch of clarified butter until golden brown and crispy. Then, and only then, finish in a moderate oven until just cooked through. Rest, darling, rest. It's essential.",
    "For the rice, sauté the shallots in more of that precious butter until translucent. Add the Arborio rice and toast lightly, stirring constantly. Deglaze with a splash of the Sancerre. Let the alcohol evaporate, then add the chicken stock a ladleful at a time, stirring until each addition is absorbed. Continue until the rice is al dente – not mushy, you philistine.",
    "Finish the rice with a generous knob of butter, a grating of Parmigiano-Reggiano (aged at least 36 months, naturally), and a scattering of fresh thyme leaves. ",
    "Deconstruct, as the name suggests, by slicing the chicken breast and arranging it artfully next to a mound of the risotto. Garnish with a sprig of thyme. Serve immediately, and try to pretend you're not eating something so utterly…ordinary."
