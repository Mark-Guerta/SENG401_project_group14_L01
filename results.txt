Recipe Name: Sublime Simplisticité: Poulet et Riz (Chicken and Rice, Elevated) 

Ingredients
Free-range chicken thighs (bone-in, skin-on, of course)
Carnaroli rice (because Arborio is simply barbaric)
Shallots (finely minced, as onions are far too vulgar)
Dry white wine (something crisp and French, naturally)
Chicken stock (homemade, I trust?)
Fresh thyme sprigs
Bay leaf
Unsalted butter (European-style, please)
Extra virgin olive oil (the good stuff)
Sea salt (Maldon, if you insist)
Freshly ground white pepper (black pepper is so déclassé)

Steps 
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). If your oven lacks precision, simply discard it and acquire a better one.
Season the chicken thighs generously with sea salt and white pepper. Don't be shy; we need to impart *some* flavor.
In an oven-safe skillet (cast iron, naturally), heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken thighs, skin-side down, until golden brown and crispy. This is crucial for texture, you see.
Remove the chicken and set aside. Add the minced shallots to the skillet and sauté until translucent. Do *not* let them brown.
Add the Carnaroli rice to the skillet and toast for a minute or two, stirring constantly. We need to awaken the starch, you understand.
Deglaze the skillet with the dry white wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. This is where the *flavor* resides, darling.
Pour in the chicken stock, ensuring it covers the rice. Add the thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Return the chicken thighs to the skillet, skin-side up.
Bring the mixture to a simmer, then transfer the skillet to the preheated oven.
Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and the chicken is tender. The rice should be creamy, not mushy.
Remove the skillet from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld, however unlikely.
Stir in a knob of unsalted butter to enrich the sauce. Remove the thyme sprigs and bay leaf before serving. We wouldn't want any unpleasant surprises.
Serve immediately. And try to pretend it's not just chicken and rice.
