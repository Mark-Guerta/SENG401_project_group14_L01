Recipe Name: Poulet et Riz Élégant (Elegant Chicken and Rice) 

Ingredients
* 1 boneless, skinless chicken breast, preferably organic and free-range, naturally
* 1/2 cup Arborio rice (NONE of that long-grain nonsense, darling)
* 2 cups homemade chicken stock, reduced by half for intense flavour (you *are* making it yourself, aren't you?)
* 1 shallot, finely minced (none of that vulgar onion)
* 1 clove garlic, crushed with the back of a knife (to release the *essence*, you see)
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, the highest quality you can find
* 1 tablespoon olive oil, extra virgin, naturally
* Fresh thyme sprigs, for infusing a touch of herbaceous elegance
* Sea salt, to taste (and I mean *taste*, not just dump in)
* Freshly ground white pepper, because black is far too common

Steps 
1. First, gently sauté the minced shallot in the olive oil and one tablespoon of butter over low heat until translucent, being careful not to brown it. We're aiming for *delicacy*, remember?
2. Add the Arborio rice and toast it lightly for a minute or two, coating each grain in the buttery goodness. This is crucial for the creamy texture, you know.
3. Deglaze the pan with a splash of dry white wine (optional, but highly recommended, darling. Use something crisp, like a Sancerre). Let it evaporate completely before proceeding.
4. Now, add a ladleful of your precious homemade chicken stock. Stir gently until the liquid is absorbed before adding another ladleful. Repeat this process, patiently, until the rice is cooked al dente. This takes time, so don't rush! Good food cannot be hurried.
5. While the rice is simmering, gently poach the chicken breast in the remaining chicken stock, along with the garlic and thyme sprigs. Simmer until cooked through, then shred it delicately with two forks. None of that rough chopping, please.
6. Once the rice is cooked, stir in the shredded chicken, the remaining tablespoon of butter, and season with sea salt and white pepper to *your* precise taste. (But please, use restraint!)
7. Serve immediately, garnished with a fresh thyme sprig. Presentation is everything, you know.
